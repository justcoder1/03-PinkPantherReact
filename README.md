<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I am building out this project to try an encompass the skills I have gained as a developer so far.

The application is hosted and you can interact with it here:

[PinkPanther_Showcase_Project](https://pinkpantherreact.netlify.app/)

The frontend is built in React and Typescript using MUI component library.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To install the application locally please use this npm command.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

### Installation

The application does utilise an environment file that you will not have access to for connecting to the backend.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Progress

There is a 'buildHistory' file in the application that I have been using to document what I have done, challenges and releases.

I had list of elements I was going to point out based on the authentication implementation but unfornately I have struggled with this today and just not achieved what I hoped.

If you view the 'issues' in GITHub you will see my thought process on tasks still outstanding and completed tasks.
